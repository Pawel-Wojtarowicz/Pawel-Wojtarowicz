### Hi there 👋 my name is Paul, i am currently working as a system administrator in a reputable organization for over 7 years. In 2021 I wanted to become a python programmer and since then I have been systematically exploring my knowledge by coding various applications. My favorite area is pure backend. Over time I have created this repository to collect my applications and test new knowledge

- 🌱 I'm currently learning Python.
- 🔭 I’m currently coding *Twitter_streamlit*
- 🏫 In my free time I write simple applications to understand the functions and methods I've learned so far. e.g. working with db, connecting to API, operating on larger data sets.
